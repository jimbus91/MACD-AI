This script is using the yfinance library to download stock data for a specific ticker symbol entered by the user. It then processes the data by calculating the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line, signal line, and histogram for the past year of data. It then uses the scikit-learn library's HistGradientBoostingRegressor to fit a model to the past year's data and make predictions for the next 30 days. The script also adds random values to the predicted prices to simulate the uncertainty in stock market predictions. Finally, it plots the data and predictions, including the MACD line, signal line, and histogram for the next 30 days.
